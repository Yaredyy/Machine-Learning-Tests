**Steps to create a model:
1. gather training data, properly filtering information
2. train the proper model using your data
3. once the ML algorithm has finished, test using new data
4. Based off the test result, retrain or submit the model



**Supervised learning:
fitting a model with labeled datasets
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = splitter(X, Y, test_size=(.05*(i+1)), random_state=42)
train data/train label -> ml algo -> test data -> response

    ***types of supervised models
    
    logistic regression, decision trees, linear regresion,
    random forest, polynomial regression, k-nearest, naive bayes

**Unsupervised learning:
No labels included
train data -> ml algo -> test data -> response

    ***types of unsupervised models
    
    k-means clustering, singular value decomp, apriori
    fuzzy means, hierarchical clustering, parital least squares
    principal component analysis




**Reinforcement learning:
after provided a test input, the model outputs a response,
and awaits feedback or the acceptment
